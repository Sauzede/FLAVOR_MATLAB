INPUT


This sub-directory contains the functions to create the input data from a fluorescence profile associated with its location and date of acquisition.
 
An example of creation of the input data for a fluorescence profile (profil.dat) is given in the script Input.m.
This script calls the function FLAVORinput (FLAVORinput.m) in which all the steps explained in the paper are computed.
