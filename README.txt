Introduction


The auxiliary material contains the codes in MATLAB language to retrieve the (1) total chlorophyll-a concentration and (2) simultaneously chlorophyll-a concentrations associated to three phytoplankton size classes (microphytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton) from a normalized fluorescence profile for ten normalized depths.
There are four sub-directory: one for the code to create the input data for the MLP with a fluorescence profile associated with its location and date of acquisition (INPUT), one for the code for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL), one for the simultaneously retrievals of the chlorophyll-a concentrations associated to three phytoplankton size classes (PSC) and one for the second step of the method which consists in retrieveing a quasi-continuous profile from the ten points retrieved by the MLP. For this last sub-directory, there are two sub-directories: one for the total chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) and one for the three phytoplankton size (PSC). Each sub-directory contains a README file explaining how to use the codes.
