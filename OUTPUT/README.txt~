OUTPUT

This sub-directory contains the functions to create the output data from the ten points retrieved by the MLP. This is the second step of the FLAVOR method.
This sub-directory contains two sub-sub directory : one for the retrieval of a quasi-continuous profile of total chlorophyll-a concentration and one of the simultaneously retrievals of three quasi continuous profiles of chlorophyll-a concentrations associated with three phytoplankton size classes.
The sripts to compute the final profile calibrated are named Output.m in each sub-directory.
